## 🧠 Part 1: Theoretical Analysis

- Role of AI tools like GitHub Copilot in reducing dev time.
- Comparison of supervised vs unsupervised learning for bug detection.
- Importance of bias mitigation in user personalization.
- AIOps case study on deployment efficiency.

## 🔧 Part 2: Practical Implementation

### Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion
- Compared manual and Copilot-generated code for sorting dictionaries.
- Result: Copilot solution is more efficient and readable.

### Task 2: Automated Testing
- Used Selenium to automate valid/invalid login scenarios.
- AI improves test coverage and resilience.

### Task 3: Predictive Analytics
- Trained a Random Forest classifier using the Breast Cancer dataset.
- Evaluated using Accuracy and F1 Score.
