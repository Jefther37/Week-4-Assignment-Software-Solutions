## Project Structure

- `report.pdf`: Summary report covering theoretical analysis, practical tasks, and ethical reflection.
- `AI_Resource_Prediction_Assignment.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook implementation of Task 3.
- `selenium_login_test.py`: Python script automating login test with Selenium.
- `screenshots/`: Contains screenshots of test results for Task 2.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Part 1: Theoretical Analysis

- Role of AI tools like GitHub Copilot in reducing dev time.
- Comparison of supervised vs unsupervised learning for bug detection.
- Importance of bias mitigation in user personalization.
- AIOps case study on deployment efficiency.

## Part 2: Practical Implementation

### Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion
- Compared manual and Copilot-generated code for sorting dictionaries.
- Result: Copilot solution is more efficient and readable.

### Task 2: Automated Testing
- Used Selenium to automate valid/invalid login scenarios.
- AI improves test coverage and resilience.

### Task 3: Predictive Analytics
- Trained a Random Forest classifier using the Breast Cancer dataset.
- Evaluated using Accuracy and F1 Score.


## üîç Part 3: Ethical Reflection

- Addressed bias risks in AI predictions.
- Proposed using IBM AI Fairness 360 for bias mitigation.

## Bonus: Innovation Proposal

**AI Auto-DocGen** ‚Äî a tool to auto-generate documentation using NLP by analyzing codebases.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, Scikit-learn, Selenium
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Chrome + ChromeDriver

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn selenium
```
