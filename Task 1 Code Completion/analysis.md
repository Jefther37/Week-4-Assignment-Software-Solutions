# Task 1 Analysis: AI vs Manual Code Completion

**Objective**

To compare code generated by GitHub Copilot with a manually written version of a function that sorts a list of dictionaries by a specific key.

**Copilot Version**

Tool Used: GitHub Copilot

Code: Used Python’s built-in sorted() function with a lambda expression.

Efficiency: Time complexity is O(n log n).

Code Quality: Concise, readable, and easy to maintain.

Robustness: Used .get() to safely access dictionary keys.

**Sample**

sorted(data, key=lambda x: x.get(sort_key, ''))


**Manual Version**

Tool Used: None (written manually)

Code: Implements Bubble Sort algorithm.

Efficiency: Time complexity is O(n²).

Code Quality: Verbose, harder to maintain, and error-prone.

Robustness: Also used .get(), but less scalable.

**Comparison**

| Feature          | Copilot Version | Manual Version |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Algorithm Used  | Built-in sorted() | Bubble Sort   |
| Time Complexity | O(n log n)      | O(n²)          |
| Readability     | High            | Low            |
| Scalability     | Excellent       | Poor           |
| Code Length     | Short           | Long           |
| Maintainability | Easy            | Harder         |

**Reflection**

Using GitHub Copilot significantly accelerated development. It suggested a clean and Pythonic solution, saving time and reducing bugs. The manual version, although functional, was inefficient and verbose. This highlights how AI can optimize routine coding tasks and promote best practices—even for beginner to intermediate developers.
